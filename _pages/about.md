## About Christian Elsen

Christian started as a Software Engineer with Cisco's Technology Center, focusing on Disruptive Innovation and Prototyping for Remote Collaboration Systems. Next, in his role as a  Technology Advisory for Data Center and Virtualization at Cisco, Christian served as a trusted advisory for M&A deals, strategy alignment as well as product and services category definition in the emerging space of data centers and virtualization technology.

As a product manager for Technology Intelligence and Strategy, Christian spearheaded Cisco’s [Technology Intelligence effort](http://blogs.cisco.com/news/scouting-the-next-big-thing-ciscos-technology-radar-2), capturing and delivering information on technology trends, opportunities and threats to enable informed decision making at the executive level.

In 2012 Christian joined VMware's Integration Engineering team, where he provided constructive feedback to product management and engineering on the implementation and operation of VMware and partner products and technologies within a cloud environment, with a focus on the networking and security eco-system and ITIL based and other operational processes. This includes architecture and implementation of virtual lab topologies with emerging VMware product releases, in order to showcase new features and product changes as part of the customer beta program, as well as the [VMworld Hands-on Labs](https://www.vmworld.com/blogs/vmworld/2012/07/18/hands-on-labs-updates-for-vmworld-2012).
