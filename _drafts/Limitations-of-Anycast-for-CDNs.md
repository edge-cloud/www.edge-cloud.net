# Anycast

Explain Anycast

## AWS Global Accelerator

# RIPE Atlas

In this post we will use RIPE Atlas to check the performance of a geographic routing enabled DNS entry.

[RIPE Atlas](https://atlas.ripe.net/) is a global network of hardware devices, called probes and anchors, that actively measure Internet connectivity. Anyone can access this data via Internet traffic maps, streaming data visualisations, and an API. RIPE Atlas users can also perform customised measurements to gain valuable data about their own networks.

I highly recommend you to consider [hosting a RIPE Atlas probe](https://atlas.ripe.net/get-involved/become-a-host/) yourself. Not only will you benefit from the data that it collects on your Internet connection, but it will also allow you to run customized measurements against various Internet targets. And in the end every additional RIPE Atlas probe will benefit the overall Internet community.

Here we will be using RIPE Atlas customized measurements to investigate the performance of DNS-based geographic routing.

# Test Setup

## RIPE Atlas setup

How is the RIPE Atlas test configured against the certificate

# Test Results

## Overview

With some Python code the gathered results can easily be turned into a GeoJSON file (See Figure 4).

## Probe Details

The way that Iâ€™ve setup the GeoJSON is to also display relevant information for each of the RIPE Atlas Probes (Figure 5).

## Explore the GeoJSON

You can explore this GeoJSON yourself below, as it is published as a [Gist to Github](https://gist.github.com/chriselsen/4756c3fb8c4f1ba3b3d14e2c22617665).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/chriselsen/4756c3fb8c4f1ba3b3d14e2c22617665.js"></script>

Give it a try and see what you'll discover!
